# OS-projects

Basic Introduction

Hi this is repository for my OS class..

Its basically for data structures used in Pintos which is linked list(different from conventional linked list), hash and bitmap

I intentionally deleted makefile and testing files but you can test the result by using testlib.exe which I have already compiled in my VS Code using bash shell

Program connects commands with the appropriate function calls and there are minor implements i made to the functions so it may be different from existing ones in Pintos Library
